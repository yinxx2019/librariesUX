    <ul>
      <li><b>Mission:</b> The University Library is a teaching organization that collaborates with faculty to prepare students for life-long learning as informed global citizens.</li>
      <li><b>Purpose:</b> to gain invaluable data on the University Library website through examining student user experience, with the end goal of hopefully improving the site’s usability for future users.</li>
      <li><b>Goal:</b> through analysis of current effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction &mdash; is to improve this usability in the future.</li>
      <li>User Experience (UX) aims to define the correct strategy by attempting to understand a site's primary users and their particular behaviors. </li>
      <li>Usability is the degree to which a software can be used by specified consumers to achieve quantified objectives with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a quantified context of use.</li>
      <li>We interviewed a small group of students, the site’s main user group and took note of their individual behaviors and emotions.</li> 
    </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="box2"><span class="title">Research Methods</span>
    <ul>
      <li>Examined the library’s website individually and then assembled a UX testing group to gain further insight.</li>
      <li>Handpicked our study participants we feel that they represent the student body here at Washington and Lee. We made sure to include both males and females, different class years, different majors, both athletes and non-athletes, domestic and international, and both greek-affiliated and not.</li>
      <li><img src="https://jasontmickel.com/dh190/site-clock.png" id="clock">Brainstormed a list of questions to ask our participants and a list of actions to ask our participants to perform.</li>
      <li>Created a consent form to give to the participants at the start of our interviews.</li>
      <li>Each interview was held in the University Library and lasted approximately thirty (30) minutes.</li>
      <li>Took descriptive notes on participants’ answers to our questions, how they performed each activity, and their emotions and reactions throughout the interviews.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="box3"><span class="title">Summary of Findings</span>
    <ul>
      <li>It should be ensured that the main page of the library website is the first result when entered into Google, as this will improve usability for the Google users.</li>
      <li>There was no trend in how often out test group visited the library site, but a majority of participants seem to visit the site mostly for class.</li>
      <li>A majority of participants listed JStor, a database in A-Z databases, as a primary reason for visiting the library website second only to the search bar.</li>
      <img src="https://jasontmickel.com/dh190/site-search-bar.jpg" alt="Site Search Bar" id="searchbar">
      <li>The search bar was the first thing noticed on the main page by a majority of participants, with the pictures and color scheme coming in second and third.</li>
      <li>When asked to search for their favorite book, all participants were able to do so quickly and with ease.</li>
      <li>Participants answered that the main purpose of the library website should be to find resources, specifically books and JStor. They felt that the current site had all the information that they needed and everyone seemed to be able to find what they are looking for within just a few minutes.</li>
      <li>Overall, the site's student UX seemed positive and usability was high; the site was extremely effective and efficient in fulfilling student needs.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="box4"><span class="title">Takeaways</span>
    <p>Overall, the site’s student UX seemed positive and usability was high, but there are still actionable to make the site more effectively and efficiently to use.</p>
    <img src="https://jasontmickel.com/dh190/site-6-blocks.jpg" alt="Six Main Block on Site" id="sixblocks">
      <ul>
      <img src="https://jasontmickel.com/dh190/site-menu-drop.jpg" alt="Menu on Site" id="menudrop" style="clear: both;">
      <li>Change the vocabulary of the six descriptions, and probably also the six images on the main page: some participants report that those six bars are somewhat repetitive and even confusing to them and they have never visited some of them.</li>
      <li>Clarifying the search bars: the search bar in the above fold is for searching books, journal, and movies in the database of the library instead of searching all of the information in the site, which confused some participants. The search bar of general information is at the bottom of the page, while some participants never noticed that before. By changing the location of that search bar, the usability might be improved. </li>
      <li>Optimizing and changing the order of the options in the drop-down menu in the second-to-top bar may help students find their desired resources easier.</li>
    </ul>
